## [Intro/Warm-up]

Hello! Thanks for taking the time to help out today.

We are a research team at UCSD interested in exploring a prototype design to help people like you decide if they want to use an open-source software project. 

Thank you for signing the consent form in advance - as mentioned in the consent, this study is not a test of your knowledge and is completely voluntary - did you have any questions about the information in the consent form?

Alright, I will start the recording now!

- [Start an online recording]

Here’s a quick question to get us into the mindset of this interview: When you’re using or considering to use open-source software in your own projects, what are 2-3 important factors you consider when evaluating that software?

- [Can clarify if the participant asks questions about this] For instance, if you’re considering importing an open-source package you’ve never heard of, and you have access to its code on GitHub, is there anything you would check before using it?

For the next part of this call, I will present you with a GitHub repository, and you will be looking through and recording any risk signals (or red flags) about the repository that might dissuade you from using it in your team’s projects. For the purposes of this study, we’d like you to contain your evaluation to the links we provide for you, which will include a repo’s GitHub web pages and potentially a static label prototype. If you have other resources you would refer to in order to evaluate some software, you are welcome to mention it at the end of this call.

As a strawman example, here is a shortened list of some risk signals you might record for a project: [share a screen with the following text typed out in a blank document, and walk through it briefly]

> Maintainers:
 - No issues have been addressed for 20 years
 - There is no documentation on how to use or contribute to this repo
 - …
Contributors:
 - No pull requests have been submitted for this repo
 - No new code has been committed to this repo for 20 years
 - …
Consumers:
 - This repo has 0 watchers and 0 stars
 - Even though it’s a software package, this project has no downstream dependents
 - …
Code:
 - Dependencies are out of date
 - There are no automated tests
 - …
> 

Okay, let’s get into the interview. In addition to recording our conversation, we would also like to record your actions on your computer, so we’d like for you to share your screen during portions of our interview. We will not be sharing the videos or any identifying information outside of our immediate research team. Do you give consent for us to record your shared screen?

- [If agree, thank them and ask them to start sharing and open up a private browser window]
- [If disagree, spend more time asking follow-up questions on their decisions in the rest of the interview]

## [1st Repo]

Now, let’s say you’re a software developer looking for open-source software to integrate in your team’s project. I will provide you a link to a GitHub repo. [If this is a label condition, also mention the link to an informative label about the repo.]

Assuming this repo’s functionality fits your use case, your goal is to look over it and list out as many potential risk signals (or red flags to consider before deciding to use the repo) as you can find. I would recommend writing these down (on a piece of paper or on a note-taking app), you do not need to discuss them out loud yet. Then, when you feel confident enough to make a decision on whether or not you would choose to integrate this repo into your organization’s work, let me know your decision. I will time you on this and may stop you early if we’re pushing our time limit. Do you have any questions?

[Provide link for GitHub and the label if in the label condition].

- roughViz: https://github.com/jwilber/roughViz
    - Trustee Label:
    - Component Label:
- [roughViz] This is a repo satisfying your organization’s use case of creating data visualizations of this certain style.

[Do not say anything, except to answer procedural questions, until the participant makes a decision or until 8 minutes are up - adjust the max time as necessary if the interview is running late]

Great! I will send you a link to a form for you to list out the risk signals you found, please take a couple minutes to fill that out then complete a brief questionnaire about this task. When it asks for your participant number, your number is [Provide the corresponding number for this participant].

[Send the link] Let me know if you have any questions about this.

- Form link: https://forms.gle/7nqizjt5YACNHDh59
- [If the participants finished very quickly and did not list out more than a couple risk signals, can follow up with categories they didn’t add signals for - e.g. “Did you consider any risk signals related to the code quality of this repo?”]

## [2nd Repo]

Feel free to close those tabs, we will do this again with another repo now. This will be the same task, but a different open source project to evaluate. You can again assume this project’s functionality fits your use case. As before, list out as many potential risk signals, then let me know when you are ready to make a decision on whether you would use this software or not. Any questions?

Here is the information [Provide link for GitHub and the label if in the label condition].

- twopasswords: https://github.com/gennadis/twopasswords
    - Trustee Label:
    - Component Label:
- [twopasswords] This is a repo satisfying your organization’s use case of managing stored passwords with facial recognition.

[Do not say anything, except to answer procedural questions, until the participant makes a decision or until 8 minutes are up - adjust the max time as necessary if the interview is running late]

Awesome! I will send you a link to a form for you to list out the risk signals you found, please take a couple minutes to fill that out then complete a brief questionnaire about this task. Again, your participant number is [Provide the corresponding number for this participant].

[Send the link] Let me know if you have any questions about this.

- Form link: https://forms.gle/7nqizjt5YACNHDh59
- [If the participants finished very quickly and did not list out more than a couple risk signals, can follow up with categories they didn’t add signals for - e.g. “Did you consider any risk signals related to the code quality of this repo?”]

## [3rd Repo]

Feel free to close those tabs, we will do this one last time. As before, list out as many potential risk signals for this new repo, then let me know when you are ready to make a decision on whether you would use this software or not. Any questions?

Here is the information [Provide link for GitHub and the label if in the label condition].

- voice-listener: https://github.com/nithincvpoyyil/voice-listener
    - Trustee Label:
    - Component Label:
- [voice-listener] This is a repo satisfying your organization’s use case of interpreting voice-based inputs.

[Do not say anything, except to answer procedural questions, until the participant makes a decision or until 8 minutes are up - adjust the max time as necessary if the interview is running late]

Nice work! I will send you a link to a form for you to list out the risk signals you found, please take a couple minutes to fill that out then complete a brief questionnaire about this task. Again, your participant number is [Provide the corresponding number for this participant].

[Send the link] Let me know if you have any questions about this.

- Form link: https://forms.gle/7nqizjt5YACNHDh59
- [If the participants finished very quickly and did not list out more than a couple risk signals, can follow up with categories they didn’t add signals for - e.g. “Did you consider any risk signals related to the code quality of this repo?”]

## [Open Feedback and Wrap-up]

Feel free to stop sharing your screen, I just have a few more questions to wrap things up.

In this study, we provided a couple informational labels about the repos. Did you find them helpful? Do you remember if a particular one was more helpful than the other?

- [Feel free to re-link the labels if the participant asks to see them again or if they didn’t look at them during the interview]

If you were the maintainer for an open source repo, would you use either of these label designs? Why or why not?

These labels are not a final design, so we would appreciate any feedback you have on them as well. Could they be more useful? What would you change about them?

Was there anything about your responses or this task you wanted to mention? Maybe any feedback on this study?

Thank you so much for helping out with this study. I can end the recording now, then I will confirm your email for the compensation payout.
